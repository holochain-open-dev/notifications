# Setting up the zomes

> This guide assumes you are inside a nix develop environment with `hc scaffold` available.

1. Scaffold a new zome pair named `notifications` with:

```bash
hc scaffold zome notifications
```

Select the "Integrity/coordinator zome pair" option, and accept the path that the scaffolding tool offers to scaffold the zomes.

2. In the new notification zome's `coordinator` and `integrity` Cargo.toml files, add:

```toml
hc_zome_notifications = { git = "https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/notifications", branch = "develop" }
```

and

```toml
hc_zome_notifications_integrity = { git = "https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/notifications", branch = "develop" }
```
respectively


3. Go into the newly scaffolded integrity zome's `lib.rs` (its path may be similar to `dnas/lobby/zomes/integrity/notifications/src/lib.rs`) and **replace its contents with**:

```rust
extern crate hc_zome_notifications_integrity;
```

4. Go into the newly scaffolded coordinator zome's `lib.rs` (its path may be similar to `dnas/lobby/zomes/coordinator/notifications/src/lib.rs`) and **replace its contents with**:

```rust
extern crate hc_zome_notifications;
use hdk::prelude::{*};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug, Clone)]
pub struct NotificationTip {
  pub retry_count: i32, //The number of times this notification has been retried. Use custom_handle_notification_tip to increment and limit.
  pub status: String, //"stop", "go" or "retry"
  pub message: String, //The message to send to the notificant
  pub notificants: Vec<AgentPubKey>, //The list of notificants to send the message to
  pub contacts: Vec<Contact>, //The list of contacts to send the message to. If left blank, contact details will automatically be retrieved based on the notificants.
  pub extra_context: String, //Any extra data that needs to be passed to the custom_handle_notification_tip function. For example, a hash of an entry.
  pub message_id: String, //A unique identifier of the message to send. For instance, a string containing a timestamp and message content. This is used to automtatically prevent duplicate messages. If left blank, there will be no prevention of duplicate notifications.
  pub destination: String, //Used for debugging. The name of the function that the data is being sent to.
}

#[hdk_extern]
pub fn custom_handle_notification_tip(notificaitonTip: NotificationTip) -> ExternResult<NotificationTip> {
  // TODO: Any customize handling of notification tip that is needed, including handling retries, collecting a list of notificants, or verifying legitimacy.
  Ok(notificaitonTip)
}
```
5. Add any custom script to the function "custom_handle_notification_tip". This function will be run by the notifier agent when they receive a notification tip. For instance, if this is a notification about an event, you may want to verify that the event exists and is happening. If the notification tip is about a peer-to-peer message, you may want to verify that the listed sender is the same agent that sent the tip.
